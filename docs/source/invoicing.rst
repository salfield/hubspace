One click Invoicing
===================

Overview
--------

This is new feature of hubspace that makes invoicing process much easier and faster.


It involves following stages

- Preparation
- Invoice generation
- Sending invoices

.. Note::
    It is still possible to do invoicing old way. Interface for old option is unchanged except the search button which is moved towards right.
 
Preparation
-----------

At this stage one is expected to add/edit all the usages you are supposed to add manually for the members and ready to do invoicing. Invoicing later does not offer you much chance to manage individual usages.

Invoice Generation
------------------

Access it by navigating to Invoicing sub tab under Hosting tab.

Click on "Generate Invoices" to auto generate invoices.

.. Note::
   Existing unsent invoices
    Generated list would also contain unsent invoices for your location. Further it will not generate invoice for a member who has such unsent invoice.
    This ensures following:

    - have all the invoices on one page ready to send.
    - even if one generates invoices more than once result would be same till you send the invoices.

Previews
~~~~~~~~

Once the invoices are generated you can optionally modify followings for an invoice
 - Message text to send with the invoice
 - P. O. Number

System will not save message text or P. O. number if you choose not to send invoices and leave the page.

Sending the invoices 
--------------------
For any reason if you want to remove certain invoices, you can do it by selecting such invoices and then clicking "Remove selected".

All selected invoices are sent when you click "Send selected". The invoices which you do not select are not removed, they remain in the system.
