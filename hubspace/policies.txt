Calculate User Access Polcies


On creation a location gets 2 policy_brokered resources ['member_book', 'host_book']
rest should be added ttw from remainder of policy_brokered list

policy_brokered = ['door_1', 'door_2', 'door_3', 'member_book', 'host_book']



=> "add policy" SU web_call for policy_names not existing
=> modify existing locations to have "member_book" and "host_book"


- gui for editing policies / add policies from policies list
* what inherits/overrides what - explain/warn

- gui for hosts and members in calendar
* if members are allowed ... as normal.
* if members are not allowed, give opportunity to email hosts.
* if neither allowed in week view - grey out days where not bookable

Policies are then combined to determine what the user can do.

We then resolve according to the most specific type of opening time for that date:

* Any specific date overiddes, any holiday, overiddes and weekday. 
* if conflicting opening times remain opening times associated with: policies overrides -> tariffs-> overrides roles -> overiddes hub
* if opening times still conflict (have the same level of date and acquisition specificity) they are addititve, meaning if either policy would allow them, they are allowed  

thereby we return a set of opening times
