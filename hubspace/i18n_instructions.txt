When receive a new pot file:

1. DONT USE  "tg-admin i18n compile" its evil and takes translations from other po files in an unpredictable way. 

When change a template (ensure that the indentation is extremely regular):
1. collect strings from tg-admin toolbox adm11n interface
Current file to select are:
  controllers.py
  templates/addBooking.kid
  templates/invoice.kid
  templates/send_invoice.kid
  validators.py 

2. tg-admin i18n merge - I think this works okay
3. remove the existing .mo files (to ensure that they will be recompiled)


4. DONT USE "tg-admin i18n compile" as this will screw things up


When adding a translation just do 2. and 3.
